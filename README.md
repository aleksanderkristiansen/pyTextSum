# pyTextSum
Simple neural extractive text summarization written in Python

This repository contains implementation of a neural approach to extractive text summarization using Tensorflow. 

_The first implementation named **"text_summarizer.py"** is intended for typical medium-to-large bodies of text such as news articles and reviews. That program implements the ideas described in the paper "[Extractive Text Summarization using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10137)"_ 

_The second implementation named **"tweet_summarizer.py"** is intended for short texts such as Tweets and other social media posts. That program implements the ideas described in the paper "[Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Relation Classification](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-2034)"_ 

_(Requires Tensorflow)_
